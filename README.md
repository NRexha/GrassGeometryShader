Creating this grass geometry shader was a big challenge for me, but it's been an incredible learning experience. The shader is written in HLSL. The goal was to generate and animate grass in real-time. This really put me out of my comfort zone and pushed me to learn new things, and while I’m aware it’s not perfect, I’m really happy with the result. In my opinion the shader brings depth and movement to the environment, and seeing it come together has been rewarding.

## Shader Parameters
The shader includes some adjustable parameters to tweak the look and feel of the grass. These include wind movement based on a normal map, controls for grass size, width, and bending, as well as two color options: base color and top color for natural gradient effects.
